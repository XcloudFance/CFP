# CFP
Official Implementation for Cross Feature Pyramid

# Abstract
- **Gaussian Attention**
- **Cross Feature Pyramid Block**
  - **Self Attention + Feature Cross Attention**
  - **Upsampling by ViT & Transpose Conv**

- Not only Centernet Encoder, Good Performance in other cross-feature pyramid network: Unet – Segmentation, UPerNet – Segmentation&Classification
- Could be parallel Encoder to transfer into one Decoder for learning – Using CFPB as well
